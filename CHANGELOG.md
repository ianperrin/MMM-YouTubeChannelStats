- The `grayscale` configuration option can be used to control the appearance of the channels thumbnail image. By default, thumbnails will be shown in grayscale. When set to `false`, thumbnails will appear as on YouTube.
- Added an animated example screenshot to illustrate multiple channel support, channel rotation and thumbnail position/display.
- Unit tests for custom functions in the core module file.

### Changed
